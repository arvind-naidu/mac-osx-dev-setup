Mac-OSX-Dev-Setup
=================

Got a shining new Macbook and have no idea of how to get it up and running for development? Don't worry as you have come to the right place.

Before diving right into setting up, lets take a moment to thank @nicoslashery as this is an advancement of his repository named mac-dev-setup. Also would like to thank @skwp for his awesome dotfiles.

This repository might look like complete shameless rip off from both the repositories but trust me, there is a personal touch put into it that makes it totally different.

We will set up Node, Python, & Ruby environments, which is mainly used for Javascript, Python and Ruby development without leaving any steps involved behind.

>Invest time learning to configure your machine and automate processes, youâ€™ll get that time back ten fold.

List of things that will be done in order to set up the new Mac:

- System Update
- System Preferences
- Dotfiles
- OSX 
- Google Chrome
- iTerm2
- Sublime Text
- Vim
- Node.js
- Ruby & RVM
- Heroku
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Projects Folder
- Apps
