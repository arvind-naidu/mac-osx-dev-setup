mac-osx-dev-setup
=================

Got a shining new Macbook and have no idea of how to get it up and running for development? Don't worry as you have come to the right place.
	
Before diving right into setting up, lets take a moment to thank [@nicoslashery](https://github.com/nicolashery) as this is an advanced version of his repository named [mac-dev-setup](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup). Also would like to thank [@skwp](https://github.com/skwp) for his awesome [dotfiles](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles).

This repository might look like a complete shameless rip off from both the repositories but trust me, there is a personal touch put into it that makes it totally different.

We will set up Node, Python, & Ruby environments, which is mainly used for Javascript, Python and Ruby development without leaving any steps involved behind. 

Along with it, we will also install frameworks to further enhance development workflow such as Yeoman, Bower, Grunt and many more.

>Invest time learning to configure your machine and automate processes, youâ€™ll get that time back ten fold.
